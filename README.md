# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Scraped-Twitter-Comments-using-Open-Pretrained-Transformers-OPT-

An assignment of the BMCS2123 Natural Language Processing course offered by TARUMT's Data Science Programme. Using Hugging Face's API, our team has performed transfer learning on the OPT-350m model to perform Sentiment Analysis on the 1MDB movie review dataset. The accuracy we achieved was 92% on the test set. During the deployment stage, we wrote a program which utilizes the Beautiful Soup library combined with Selenium to scrape comments from Twitter and perform sentiment analysis using the aforementioned model. Users can choose to select the topic to scrape as well as the number of comments to analyze.
